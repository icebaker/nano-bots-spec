**Nano Bots** is an open specification that can be implemented in any programming language. It specifies a configuration file with human-readable instructions for creating small and specialized AI-powered bots that can be effortlessly shared as a single, lightweight file.

## Example

Here's what a Nano Bot _Cartridge_ looks like:

```yaml
---
name: Assistant
version: 0.0.1

behaviors:
  interaction:
    directive: You are a helpful assistant.

interfaces:
  repl:
    prompt:
      - text: 'ðŸ¤–'
      - text: '> '
        color: blue

provider:
  name: openai
  settings:
    model: gpt-3.5-turbo
    credentials:
      address: ENV/OPENAI_API_ADDRESS
      access-token: ENV/OPENAI_API_ACCESS_TOKEN
      user-identifier: ENV/OPENAI_API_USER_IDENTIFIER
```

Here's what a fully-functional implementation of Nano Bots feels like:

```bash
nano-bot to-en-us-translator.yml - eval "Salut, comment Ã§a va?"
# => Hello, how are you doing?

nano-bot midjourney.yml - eval "happy and friendly cyberpunk robot"
# => The robot exploring a bustling city, surrounded by neon lights
#    and high-rise buildings. The prompt should include colorful
#    lighting and a sense of excitement in the facial expression.

nano-bot lisp.yml - eval "(+ 1 2)"
# => 3

cat article.txt |
  nano-bot to-en-us-translator.yml - eval |
  nano-bot summarizer.yml - eval
# -> LLM stands for Large Language Model, which refers to an
#    artificial intelligence algorithm capable of processing
#    and understanding vast amounts of natural language data,
#    allowing it to generate human-like responses and perform
#    a range of language-related tasks.
```

```bash
nano-bot assistant.yml - repl
```

```text
ðŸ¤–> Hi, how are you doing?

As an AI language model, I do not experience emotions but I am functioning
well. How can I assist you?

ðŸ¤–> |
```
