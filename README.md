## Example

Here's what a Nano Bot _Cartridge_ looks like:

```yaml
---
meta:
  name: Nano Bot Name
  symbol: ðŸ¤–
  author: Your Name
  version: 0.0.1

behaviors:
  interaction:
    directive: You are a helpful assistant.

provider:
  name: openai
  settings:
    model: gpt-3.5-turbo
    credentials:
      address: ENV/OPENAI_API_ADDRESS
      access-token: ENV/OPENAI_API_ACCESS_TOKEN
      user-identifier: ENV/OPENAI_API_USER_IDENTIFIER
```

Here's what a fully-functional implementation of Nano Bots feels like:

```bash
nb - - eval "hello"
# => Hello! How may I assist you today?

nb to-en-us-translator.yml - eval "Salut, comment Ã§a va?"
# => Hello, how are you doing?

nb midjourney.yml - eval "happy cyberpunk robot"
# => A cheerful and fun-loving robot is dancing wildly amidst a
#    futuristic and lively cityscape. Holographic advertisements
#    and vibrant neon colors can be seen in the background.

nb lisp.yml - eval "(+ 1 2)"
# => 3

cat article.txt |
  nb to-en-us-translator.yml - eval |
  nb summarizer.yml - eval
# -> LLM stands for Large Language Model, which refers to an
#    artificial intelligence algorithm capable of processing
#    and understanding vast amounts of natural language data,
#    allowing it to generate human-like responses and perform
#    a range of language-related tasks.
```

```bash
nb - - repl

nb assistant.yml - repl
```

```text
ðŸ¤–> Hi, how are you doing?

As an AI language model, I do not experience emotions but I am functioning
well. How can I assist you?

ðŸ¤–> |
```
